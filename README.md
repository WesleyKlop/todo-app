# Todo api thingy

Made this as an excuse to dabble with the following things:

- tilt
- go
- opentelemetry
- jaeger
- vite
- lit
- kubernetes

## To start

Run `tilt up`.

But first you need to have installed:

- go
- tilt
- docker desktop (or other k8s context)
  - ingress controller
- node
- kustomize
- maybe some other things idk

## Urls:

- Jaeger: http://jaeger.127.0.0.1.nip.io/
- Todo app: http://todo.127.0.0.1.nip.io/
